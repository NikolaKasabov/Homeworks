        <article>

          <p>
            Eight years ago we set out to create a series of awards that were
            unique. We wanted to impartially identify the very best in the game,
            judged by experts who could draw on real-life experiences to inform
            their vote. They had to be people with unrivalled knowledge and passion
            for travel and food. They had to be people like you. Unlike other
            industry awards, ours are entirely nominated and voted on by Food and
            Travel readers.</p>
          <p>So rack your brains and give credit where it’s due
            by submitting your nomination by logging in using the button on the top
            right of the page. Maybe it was an undiscovered gourmet bolthole that
            wowed at the weekend; a restaurant that served a memorable meal; a hotel
            that provided the perfect stay or perhaps a cruise line that went the
            extra (nautical) mile. Whatever has impressed you over the past 12
            months, we want to hear about it.</p>
          <p>The shortlist will be revealed in the July issue of Food and Travel. Click <a href="https://foodandtravel.com/subscribe">here</a>
            to be one of the first to find out whose made the shortlist by getting
            the latest issue delivered straight to your door. Use the code <strong>2203</strong> for<strong> 20% </strong>off
            the annual subscription price. That's just £38.40 for a UK
            subscription. For overseas subscriptions please call 00 44 (0) 20 7501
